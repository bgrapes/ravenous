## Project Progress ##
See how this code progressed throughout my course:

[Ravenous I - Create Static Components - Day 7](https://github.com/bgrapes/ravenous/tree/ravenous-1)
* I used `create-react-app` to start my project.
* The project contains three components: `Business`, `BusinessList`, and `SearchBar`.
* The `App` component renders a `SearchBar` component and a `BusinessList` component.
* This is just a simulation of what the finished project will look like.
* Business information is currently hardcoded, but later I'll be querying the Yelp API.

[Ravenous II - Pass Information - Day 10](https://github.com/bgrapes/ravenous/tree/ravenous-2)
* I moved business information to the container component (`App`).
* Business information is now passed from the parent component (`App`) to the child components (`Business` and `BusinessList`).

[Ravenous III - Set State of Components - Day 14](https://github.com/bgrapes/ravenous/tree/ravenous-3)
* I added visual feedback to the sorting options.
* Set the state of the sorting options and inputs.
* Simulated a search query by logging the criteria the console.

[Ravenous IV - Add Interaction with Yelp API - Day 20](https://github.com/bgrapes/ravenous/tree/ravenous-4)
* I replaced hard coded values with real data from the Yelp API.
